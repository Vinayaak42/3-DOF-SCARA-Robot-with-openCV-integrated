## 📌 Project Overview
The pharmaceutical industry requires **high precision** in medicine packaging to ensure **patient safety**, **regulatory compliance**, and **product integrity**. Manual inspection methods are **slow**, **inconsistent**, and **error-prone**, making automation essential.

This project introduces an **AI-powered quality inspection system** that:
- Uses **YOLOv5** for real-time defect detection.
- Controls a **3-DOF SCARA Robot** for pick-and-place operations.
- Runs on **Raspberry Pi 4** for **edge computing**.

### ✅ Key Highlights:
✔ Real-time detection of defective and non-defective medicine boxes  
✔ Fully automated inspection system with robotic handling  
✔ Accuracy of **95% on custom dataset**  
✔ Lightweight deployment using Raspberry Pi for industrial environments  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate quality inspection in pharmaceutical packaging.
- Detect defects such as **improper sealing, damaged packaging, and incorrect labeling**.
- Reduce **manual errors** and **increase inspection speed**.
- Achieve **real-time defect detection** and reporting.

**Workflow:**
1. Camera captures high-resolution images of medicine boxes.
2. **YOLOv5 model** detects defects (sealed/unsealed, damaged packaging).
3. SCARA Robot performs **pick-and-place** operations:
   - Non-defective → Production line
   - Defective → Rejection bin
4. Results displayed on **GUI** for operator monitoring.
